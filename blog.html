                <p>
                    I would rename the Born a crime - <b>"Echoes of My Childhood"</b>. <br>
                    I would say the book narrates Trevor's childhood and most of what happened during his childhood <br>
                    has shaped him to who he is today. He also connects his personal memories to the larger historical

                    happenies of that time. For Trevor to Navigate through the apartheid he used humour as armour. He
                    used <br>
                    it to talk to people and fit in and even to get out of trouble. One of his career paths ends up
                    being comedy. <br> where he uses humour to make a living.

                <h1>Reflective blog</h1>
                <p> "Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife… but he never fell in love with
                    subservient women… 'He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.'”
                </p>
                <p>Traditionally, most women  were expected to be submissive to their husbands and serve them. I would <br>
                    say they were raised up to be kept by men. Likewise in  morden relationships this is not the case. <br> 
                    In modern society the definition of gender roles seems to have changed. what was termed to be men jobs <br>
                    and roles, women roles and jobs has turned to be an outdated notion. <br>
 <br>
                    Just as Particia defied the rules of tradition and made a different life for herself, most women <br>
                    tend to do the same currently. They aspire to take roles which previously we designated only for men,<br>
                    and even do them better than men. Though society still expects her to be under a man. My opinion would be: <br>
                    Love should not be a way for a man to  cage a woman but it should be honouring 
                    each other's freedom, even when the tradition dictates otherwise.</p>
