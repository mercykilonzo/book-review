                <p>
                    I would rename the Born a crime - <b>"Echoes of My Childhood"</b>. <br>
                    I would say the book narrates Trevor's childhood and most of what happened during his childhood <br>
                    has shaped him to who he is today. He also connects his personal memories to the larger historical
                    <br>
                    happenies of that time. For Trevor to Navigate through the apartheid he used humour as armour. He
                    used <br>
                    it to talk to people and fit in and even to get out of trouble. One of his career paths ends up
                    being comedy. <br> where he uses humour to make a living.

                    subservient women… 'He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.'”
